    <p>The Force is a mysterious energy field created by life that binds the galaxy together. Harnessing the power of the Force gives the Jedi, the Sith, and others sensitive to this spiritual energy extraordinary abilities, such as levitating objects, tricking minds, and seeing things before they happen. While the Force can grant users powerful abilities, it also directs their actions. And it has a will of its own, which both scholars and mystics have spent millennia seeking to understand. The Force is sometimes referred to in terms of "dark" and "light" sides, with villains like the Sith drawing on the dark side to act aggressively while the Jedi use the light side for defense and peace. A person's intentions when using the Force—their "will to be selfless or selfish"—is what distinguishes light and dark sides.</p>
    <p>Mystics and scholars have long debated the origins of the Force, such as where and when civilizations first became aware of its power, resulting in many answers and none that were considered definitive. Different species have their own names for the Force as well as their own metaphors for how they perceived it and techniques for learning its powers.</p>
    <p>The Force exists in two forms: the Living Force and the Cosmic Force. The Living Force represents the energies of all lifeforms, and those energies are fed into the Cosmic Force which is responsible for binding the galaxy together and communicating the will of the Force. Though only certain individuals are Force-sensitive, the Force resides within all living things and could be extracted. Because of this, Force-sensitives can feel a "disturbance in the Force" whenever there is a great loss of life. Droids, however, being mechanical creations, can never sense the Force.</p>

    <p>Aside from the Jedi and Sith, over fifty organizations and sects of Force users exist, each with varying philosophies on the nature of the Force and how to use it. By harnessing the power of the Force, Jedi and other Force users can gain extraordinary reflexes in battle, manipulate weak minds, heal, and even cheat death. Throughout the galaxy, various organizations either practice or follow the Force. These factions include the Inquisitorius and the Knights of Ren. In addition, the Dagoyan Order was also composed of Force-sensitives, while the Nightsisters of Dathomir wielded dark-side magick. The Church of the Force, the Guardians of the Whills, the Frangawl Cult, and the Lasat mystics were examples of a group that worshiped the Force or some aspect of it.</p>
    <p>Notable Force users:
        <ul>
            <li>Luke Skywalker
            <li>Anakin Skywalker
            <li>Master Yoda
            <li>Emperor Palpatine
            <li>Jar Jar Binks (disputed)
        </ul>

    <p>Force-sensitivity varies with each individual, but some species are generally more Force-sensitive than others. For example, the Sith species, whose culture and philosophies would eventually evolve into an order of dark side users, was made up entirely of Force-sensitive beings. On the other hand, certain species, such as Hutts, lack Force-sensitivity and are resistant to Force powers.</p>
    <p>Force-sensitives, also known also known as Force-users, Force wielders, or Force Adepts, are sentient and non-sentient lifeforms that possess a strong connection to the mystical energy field known as the Force. Though the term applies to anyone who was sensitive to the spiritual energy, those who harness powers given by the dark side of the Force were known as dark side adepts. The progeny of Force-sensitives can inherit their progenitor's power, as was the case in the Skywalker family. Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One, passed his strength to his children, the twins Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, who, in turn, passed it to her son Ben Solo.</p>
    <p>Throughout galactic history various religious orders have trained Force-sensitives to control their abilities, such as the Jedi Order and the Sith. During the Imperial Era, Force-sensitives were hunted by a team of Jedi hunters known as the Inquisitorius. A Jedi holocron containing the list of all known Force-sensitive younglings throughout the galaxy was sought by the Second Sister and Padawan Cal Kestis. With the destruction of the Sith Lords Darth Sidious and Darth Vader, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker trained a generation of Force-sensitive students in hopes of restoring the Jedi.</p>

    <p>Some Force-sensitive people derive special, psychic abilities from the Force, such as telekinesis, mind control, and extrasensory perception. also, the Force is also used by people who are neither Jedi nor Sith, such as Leia Organa and Kylo Ren. Force users use their Force powers in myriad ways, including Obi-Wan using a "mind trick" to undermine a stormtrooper's will, Darth Vader choking subordinates without touching them, Rey lifting a large pile of rocks, and Kylo Ren stopping blaster fire mid-air.</p>
    <p>While some Force techniques were practiced by those on either the dark side or the light, such as telekinesis and the ability to sedate or induce sleep, certain powers could only be harnessed depending on the user's stance in the Force. Jedi younglings were taught that the Force could be used for many purposes, including protection, persuasion, wisdom, the manipulation of matter and the performance of great physical feats.</p>
    <p>Yet whereas the Jedi harnessed the light side's abilities through a mental state of peace and calmness, the Sith relied on their passion for strength, granting them access to powers that others considered unnatural. For instance, Force lightning was a dark side ability used to torture, disfigure, and kill one's victims. Another example of the dark side's power was Force choke; by visualizing the ability with a claw-like or crushing hand gesture, the user could strangle a victim either to intimidate or kill them. In contrast to the dark side, only the light granted the ability to preserve one's consciousness after death. Those who gained this power could become Force spirits—beings who achieved immortality by retaining their identities after becoming one with the Force.</p>

    <p>A lightsaber is a blade made of pure energy wielded by Force-users in the Star Wars universe. Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi describes the lightsaber as "not as clumsy or random as a blaster. An elegant weapon for a more civilized age." Although Jedi first experimented with lightsaber technology around 15,500 BBY, the lightsaber did not become the standard Jedi weapon until around 4,800 BBY. That means they were millennia-old by the time of Obi-Wan Kenobi. After the purge of the Jedi, lightsabers became rare as the survivors were hunted down, and only Darth Vader was commonly seen with a lightsaber.</p>
    <p>Lightsabers are not mass-produced like blasters; rather, they are very personalized weapons. Creating a lightsaber is one of the final steps of a Jedi's training. The Jedi must meditate over the lightsaber crystals, imbuing them with Force energy, affecting the weapon's power and special characteristics. A well-crafted lightsaber is not just a weapon, but an extension of the Jedi's connection to the Force. </p>

    <p>Although it's been clearly stated that droids cannot use the Force, this webpage's author did not clearly read the assignment.  So here is some sample code that a droid might implement if it could indeed use the force:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Using Force Push:<code>forcePush(weight);</code>
    <li>Using Mind Control:<code>!theDroidsYoureLookingFor</code>
    <li>Sensing Disturbance: <code>for(theForce) {
    sense(disturbance);
}</code>
    <li>Moving Rocks: <code>while (rock != lifted) {
    lift(rock);
}</code>
    <li>Force Lightning:<code>if (target == Jedi) 
    forcelightning(target); 
else printf('good, good, let your hate flow");</code>
</ul>
